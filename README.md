This open-source project, developed under the MIT license, originated in 2023 as my entry in the "Feria de ciencia y tecnologia - UNI, Managua, Nicaragua," where it secured second place in the web pages category.

The project's source code serves as an excellent resource for individuals seeking to grasp the fundamentals of Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

Key Features:

Free and Open to All: Utilize the functionalities of this project without any cost. It allows the automated sending of personalized messages via WhatsApp.

Flexible Scheduling: Schedule messages to be sent at any hour and minute within a 24-hour range. The program automatically dispatches messages at the programmed times.
